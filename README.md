# Scheema Retail
This project is a practical implementation focused on Ipswich Retail, aiming to transition from a monolithic system architecture to a more scalable and efficient Django MVT (Model-View-Template) framework. The goal is to address the limitations of the current system and enhance flexibility, maintainability, and performance by adopting a more modular approach.
